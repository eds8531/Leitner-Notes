# Leitner-Notes
A program that reads notes and creates flashcards. The program then creates daily flashcards lists. If you get a card wrong, you will see it again tomorrow. If you get a card right, you will see the card at a date later than tomorrow. The more consecutive times you get a card right, the longer the period before you will see it again.
